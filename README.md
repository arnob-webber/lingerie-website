### Adding New Products

To add new products to the "Featured Products" section, follow these steps:

1. Open `index.html`.
2. Find the section with the `id="featured-products"`.
3. Add a new `div` with the class `product` within the `products-wrapper` `div`. For example:

    ```html
    <div class="product">
        <img src="https://example.com/product-image.jpg" data-hover="https://example.com/hover-image.jpg" alt="Product Name">
        <h3>Product Name</h3>
        <p>Rs. 1,299.00</p>
        <button>Add to Cart</button>
    </div>
    ```

### Changing Styles

To modify the styles of the website, edit the `design.css` file. You can change colors, fonts, layout, and other styles as needed.
